# My3DIS Module Guide (Index)

This repository centralises module documentation in a small number of canonical guides:

- `src/my3dis/OVERVIEW.md` – execution-order tour of the core package and where each stage fits.
- `src/my3dis/workflow/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` – YAML parsing, scene scheduling, parallel execution, and summary export.
- `src/my3dis/tracking/TRACKING_GUIDE.md` – SAM2 tracking internals, data flow, and artifact writers.

Additional utilities (reporting, maintenance scripts, etc.) document themselves inline or in per-module README files to avoid duplication. This index remains as a lightweight entry point for developers landing in `src/my3dis/`.
