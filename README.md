# FamilyPart: Training-free Open-vocabulary 3D Hierarchical Part Instance Segmentation via a Multi-level Family Tree

FamilyPart is a **training-free** research system for open-vocabulary 3D part-level instance segmentation. It constructs a family-like hierarchical structure by progressively segmenting images at multiple levels of granularity and aggregates 2D masklets into 3D proposals with cross-frame consistency enforced by class-agnostic mask supervision between deep learning models.

**Important Note**: This is an experimental research system. While it demonstrates the potential of training-free approaches using only posed RGB-D image sequences and 3D point clouds, the current mean average precision is not fully satisfactory compared to existing methods. We identify key failure modes and propose several directions for improvement.

## Research Motivation

Traditional 3D instance segmentation approaches operate at a single granularity level, missing the hierarchical nature of real-world scenes. In more complex scenarios, it is crucial to identify specific parts of objects. However, conventional 3D part-level instance segmentation pipelines are often constrained to a closed set of objects or parts, causing them to lose functionality outside of their training datasets.

**Key Challenge**:
1. Maintain consistent identity across frames at multiple granularity levels
2. Track which fine-level masks belong to which coarse-level objects
3. Handle deduplication when the same object is proposed at different levels
4. Preserve complete provenance from 2D masks → tracked objects → 3D proposals

**Our Approach**: Develop a **training-free pipeline** that:
- Constructs hierarchical, family-like structures based on different granularities
- Resolves ambiguity inherent in coarse-to-fine segmentation backbone models
- Does NOT require pre-segmented superpoint structures or 3D masks
- Depends solely on posed RGB-D image sequences and 3D point cloud structure

## Method Overview

### Stage 1: Multi-level Class-agnostic Family Tree Construction with Semantic-SAM

**Solo Photo Method**:
1. Prompt Semantic-SAM at three levels (e.g., L2=coarse, L4=medium, L6=fine)
2. For each L2 instance, conduct logical AND operation between original image and mask, padding black pixels as background → "solo photo"
3. Use solo photos as input and prompt Semantic-SAM at L4 to segment children
4. Output binary masks of children are ANDed with parents, ensuring children masks are always inside parents
5. Discard masks identical to parents or whose area is below threshold
6. Apply same procedure for L6 instances
7. Construct entire family tree and assign unique mask IDs via lookup table

**Gap Filling**:
- Extract connected pixel regions not covered by any highest-level mask
- Record as independent mask if area exceeds threshold
- Only applied at highest level to avoid missing objects

### Stage 2: Provenance-aware SAM2 Tracking and Deduplication

**Window-Based Method**:
- Sampling strategy with propagation stride of 50 (retain one frame every 50 frames)
- For each Semantic-SAM prompt frame, construct subsequence of length 2F+1 (F=30)
- Run SAM2 propagation within each overlapping window
- SAM2 maintains internal memory across windows

**Deduplication and Virtual Children**:
- Use Semantic-SAM masks as prompts for SAM2 video propagation
- Compare SAM2-tracked masks with Semantic-SAM masks using IoU
- If IoU > threshold, consider object already tracked
- **Virtual children mechanism**: Rejected Semantic-SAM candidates preserved at provenance level
  - System uses mask ID to determine which existing SAM2 object to merge into
  - Updates lookup table with virtual child relationships
  - O(1) time traceability to parent object
  - Ensures semantic relationships not lost due to deduplication

### Stage 3: 3D Proposal Aggregation and Feature Extraction

**Family-aware Proposal Merging**:
- Back-project 2D masklets into 3D space using camera intrinsic/extrinsic matrices
- Aggregate per-frame 3D masks by taking spatial union
- Apply minimum volume threshold to filter small proposals
- Merge overlapping proposals using IoU threshold of 0.5:
  - Top-level objects: merge and reassign child nodes to same parent
  - Lower-level nodes: merge restricted to siblings within same family tree

**3D Proposal Feature Extraction**:
- Use LAION-CLIP (768-dim) or SigLIP (1152-dim) encoders
- Multi-scale cropping (3 scales) by expanding bounding box outward
- L₂ normalization followed by averaging
- Temporal Gaussian weighting + bounding-box area weighting:
  - `wₖ = exp(-(k-c/σ)²) × √Aₖ`
  - `c = (K-1)/2`, `σ = K/4`
- Template-based text encoding: "a {part} of {object} in a room"

### Stage 4: Open-Vocabulary Query Inference

Three retrieval strategies are designed:

1. **Hierarchical Strategy** (Top-down family-tree guided):
   - Retrieve top-K₁ L2 candidates with highest similarity to object query
   - Collect L4 children if similarity exceeds threshold
   - Search descendants (L4/L6) for top-K₂ part candidates
   - Apply Cross-path NMS (only part proposals as NMS masks)
   - Sensitive to quality of highest-level proposals

2. **Exhaustive Pairing Strategy** (Enumerate all combinations):
   - Consider six (object, part) level combinations: (L2,L2), (L2,L4), (L2,L6), (L4,L4), (L4,L6), (L6,L6)
   - Retain top-K pairs with highest similarity scores
   - Validate pairings in 3D space, discard non-overlapping
   - Apply Cross-path NMS
   - Higher pairing complexity but bypasses family tree limitations

3. **Independent Strategy** (Decouple object and part retrieval):
   - Match highest level (L2) against object query
   - Match lower levels (L4/L6) against part query
   - Compute geometric score based on IoU and size ratio
   - Combine with retrieval scores via weighted average
   - **Best performance** in experiments

## Experimental Results

### Dataset and Metrics
- **Dataset**: MultiScan with Search3D benchmark
  - 155 object + 15 part categories
  - 47 (object, part) pairs
  - 41 scenes (4 without ground-truth annotations)
- **Metric**: Mean Average Precision (mAP) under Search3D protocol

### Performance Summary

| Configuration | mAP | AP50 | AP25 |
|--------------|-----|------|------|
| **FamilyPart (Best: L1/3/5, SigLIP, Independent)** | **1.0** | **3.4** | **14.7** |
| Search3D [1] (Baseline) | 7.9 | 14.5 | 31.5 |

### Strategy Comparison (Averaged over 7 Experiments)

| Strategy | mAP | AP50 | AP25 |
|----------|-----|------|------|
| Independent | 0.84 | 2.90 | 8.59 |
| Exhaustive | 0.51 | 1.54 | 8.39 |
| Hierarchical | 0.25 | 0.75 | 7.01 |

### Level Comparison (LAION-CLIP, min. area=500)

| Level | Independent<br/>mAP/AP50/AP25 | Hierarchical<br/>mAP/AP50/AP25 | Exhaustive<br/>mAP/AP50/AP25 |
|-------|------|------------|------------|
| L1/L3/L5 | 1.2 / 3.7 / 8.0 | 0.0 / 0.1 / 4.3 | 1.1 / 3.2 / 11.0 |
| L2/L4/L6 | 0.3 / 1.6 / 6.8 | 0.9 / 2.3 / 10.7 | 0.0 / 0.2 / 7.8 |

### Feature Extractor Comparison (L1/3/5, min. area=100)

| Model | Independent<br/>mAP/AP50/AP25 | Hierarchical<br/>mAP/AP50/AP25 | Exhaustive<br/>mAP/AP50/AP25 |
|-------|------|------------|------------|
| LAION-CLIP | 1.2 / 3.7 / 11.4 | 0.0 / 0.1 / 3.8 | 0.5 / 1.4 / 8.3 |
| SigLIP | 1.1 / 3.1 / 11.8 | 0.1 / 0.4 / 6.6 | 0.9 / 2.7 / 9.7 |

**Key Findings**:
- Fewer than half of 41 scenes achieve non-zero mAP
- Hierarchical strategy performs particularly poorly (only 1 scene with non-zero mAP)
- Independent strategy achieves best AP
- SigLIP generally outperforms LAION-CLIP
- Performance still notably behind Search3D baseline

## Key Failure Modes

### 1. Deduplication Issue (Primary Problem)

**Problem**: IoU-only criterion destroys hierarchical structure
- When SAM2 tracks across viewpoints, same object may be represented by masks of different granularities
- Masks at different scales suppress each other using IoU-only comparison
- Intended hierarchical structure is effectively destroyed
- Part masks occasionally larger than corresponding object masks

**Impact**:
- Hierarchical strategy fails almost completely
- Assumption that children are always contained inside parents no longer holds
- L2/L4/L6 combination performs worse than L1/L3/L5

### 2. Aggressive Filtering

Due to hardware constraints:
- Increased minimum area threshold to save memory
- Many fine-grained part-level masks discarded
- Further degrades part-level performance

### 3. Feature Alignment

- SigLIP and LAION-CLIP alone insufficient for tight alignment
- Even with ground-truth 3D masks, not every label attains similarity > 0.8
- Considerable variation across labels

---

## Future Directions

Based on current findings, we identify promising directions for improvement:

1. **Size-aware Deduplication Module**
   - Distinguish whether two masks stand in containment relationship or are truly identical
   - Explicitly account for relative mask size
   - Preserve children when appropriate, rather than relying solely on IoU

2. **Scale-adaptive Filtering**
   - Different granularity levels should not share single, global minimum-area threshold
   - Prevent fine-grained part-level masks from being discarded

3. **Enhanced Scoring Mechanisms**
   - More sophisticated weighting or feature fusion strategies
   - Improve feature alignment between 3D proposals and text queries

## Design Philosophy

### Training-Free Approach
This work demonstrates the potential of developing 3D part segmentation pipelines using only:
- Posed RGB-D image sequences
- 3D point clouds
- Pre-trained foundation models (Semantic-SAM, SAM2, SigLIP/CLIP)

No training or fine-tuning required for novel environments.

### Provenance Tracking
Rather than post-hoc spatial containment, FamilyPart tracks provenance from mask generation:
- Explicit parent-child relationships across levels
- Virtual children for complete lineage preservation
- O(1) parent lookup through unified mapping

### Honest Reporting
We openly acknowledge that current results are not fully satisfactory. The deduplication issues significantly impact performance. This transparency helps future research identify and address these limitations.
