## 🔴 Critical: Broken Modules & Blockers

### ✅ **FIXED: Wrapper Modules Removed**
**Status:** Resolved (2025-10-21)

**Action Taken:**
- Deleted 5 broken wrapper modules: `workflow_runner.py`, `ssam_generator.py`, `sam2_tracker.py`, `candidate_filter.py`, `ssam_adapter.py`
- All original working modules preserved: `run_workflow.py`, `generate_candidates.py`, `track_from_candidates.py`, `filter_candidates.py`
- Module imports verified successfully

**Previous Issue:**
Five CLI wrapper modules were Markdown-formatted code snippets with placeholder bodies, causing import and syntax errors. These modules attempted to rename existing modules for "clarity" but were never properly implemented.

---

### ✅ **FIXED: setup.py Removed**
**Status:** Resolved (2025-10-21)

**Action Taken:**
- Deleted `setup.py` as package installation is not needed
- Users continue using `PYTHONPATH=src` for running modules
- Simplified project structure without packaging complexity

**Previous Issue:**
`setup.py` contained only placeholder comments and broken entry points:
```python
# ...existing setup code...
setup(
    # ...existing setup parameters...
    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": [
            "my3dis-workflow=my3dis.workflow_runner:main",  # ← Broken
            "my3dis-ssam=my3dis.ssam_generator:main",       # ← Broken
            "my3dis-sam2=my3dis.sam2_tracker:main",         # ← Broken
            ...
        ],
    },
)
```

**Impact:**
- `pip install .` and `python -m build` fail
- Cannot distribute as proper Python package
- Users must use `PYTHONPATH=src` workaround

**Fix:** Either complete `setup.py` with proper metadata or create `pyproject.toml` with working entry points

---

### ✅ **FIXED: Module Duplication Resolved**
**Status:** Resolved (2025-10-21)

**Action Taken:**
- Deleted duplicate `candidate_filter.py` (3.6KB broken module)
- Kept working `filter_candidates.py` (8.7KB with `RawCandidateArchiveReader`)

**Previous Issue:**
Two modules claimed to do the same thing, with `candidate_filter.py` importing non-existent symbols from deprecated modules.

---

## 🟠 High Priority: Architecture Problems

### ✅ **FIXED: Configuration System Simplified**
**Status:** Resolved (2025-10-21)

**Action Taken:**
- Deleted unused `config.py` (4.8KB dataclass-based system)
- Kept working dict-based system (`workflow/io.py`, `workflow/scenes.py`)
- System now uses single, consistent configuration approach

**Previous Issue:**
Two independent configuration systems existed - a dataclass-based system (`config.py`) that was never used, and a dict-based system in the workflow package that actually worked. This caused confusion and maintenance burden.

---

### ✅ **FIXED: Progressive Refinement Simplified**
**Status:** Resolved (2025-10-21)

**Action Taken:**
- Deleted `progressive_refinement.py` (2.3KB deprecation wrapper)
- Deleted `progressive_refinement_core.py` (1.4KB another deprecation wrapper)
- Updated `ssam_progressive_adapter.py` to import directly from `semantic_refinement`
- Removed deprecation warnings from logs

**Previous Issue:**

Three layers of indirection for one algorithm:

```
progressive_refinement.py (2.3KB)
  ↓ deprecation shim
progressive_refinement_core.py (1.4KB)
  ↓ another deprecation shim
semantic_refinement.py (28KB)
  ↓ actual implementation
```

**Current state:**
- `progressive_refinement.py`: Emits `DeprecationWarning`, re-exports from `semantic_refinement`
- `progressive_refinement_core.py`: Also emits warning, re-exports from `semantic_refinement`
- `ssam_progressive_adapter.py`: Still imports from `progressive_refinement_core` (line 42)

**Impact:**
- Confusing import paths
- Deprecation warnings spam logs
- Cleanup work abandoned mid-migration

**Fix:**
1. Update `ssam_progressive_adapter.py` to import from `semantic_refinement` directly
2. Delete `progressive_refinement.py` and `progressive_refinement_core.py`
3. Remove compatibility exports from `semantic_refinement.py`

---

### **sys.path Patching Scattered Everywhere**

At least 10 files manually patch `sys.path`:
- `run_workflow.py` (lines 5-14)
- `generate_candidates.py` (lines 6-13)
- `track_from_candidates.py`
- `filter_candidates.py`
- Each has nearly identical boilerplate

**Impact:**
- Brittle path assumptions
- Harder to package properly
- Code duplication

**Fix:**
- Create single `src/my3dis/_bootstrap.py` with path setup
- Import it from entrypoints
- Or fix `setup.py` so imports work without path hacks

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority: Simplification Opportunities

### **Naming Inconsistencies**

Multiple confusing name pairs:
- `ssam_progressive_adapter.py` (12KB, working) vs `ssam_adapter.py` (439 bytes, broken wrapper)
- `generate_report.py` (8.9KB, working) vs `report_builder.py` (2.9KB, incomplete wrapper)
- `semantic_refinement.py` vs `progressive_refinement.py` vs `progressive_refinement_core.py`

**Impact:** Developers unsure which file to edit

**Fix:** Choose one naming scheme and stick to it

---

### ✅ **FIXED: Cleaned Up CLI Entrypoints**
**Status:** Resolved (2025-10-21)

**Current State:**
Now 6 working CLI entrypoints remain (appropriate for different pipeline stages):
```bash
filter_candidates.py         # ✓ Working - Filter raw candidates
generate_candidates.py       # ✓ Working - Generate SSAM candidates
generate_report.py           # ✓ Working - Generate reports
prepare_tracking_run.py      # ✓ Working - Prepare tracking
run_workflow.py             # ✓ Working - Main workflow orchestrator
track_from_candidates.py    # ✓ Working - SAM2 tracking
```

**Previous Issue:**
10 modules defined `main()` functions, with 4 broken wrapper modules mixed in with 6 working modules.

---

## 📋 Recently Shipped (Preserved from Original)

- Environment overrides now cover all external mounts (repos, checkpoints, datasets, outputs) so ops scripts stop baking static paths. `src/my3dis/pipeline_defaults.py:9`
- SAM2 tracking streams manifests instead of bundling giant arrays in memory; frame/object archives are emitted via the manifest writers. `src/my3dis/track_from_candidates.py:73`, `src/my3dis/tracking/outputs.py:132`
- Raw SSAM candidates write through chunked tar archives with manifests, letting us rerun filters without hydrating huge JSON blobs. `src/my3dis/raw_archive.py:15`
- Stage execution captures CPU/GPU peaks and serialises `environment_snapshot.json` + `workflow_summary.json` for each run. `src/my3dis/workflow/summary.py:94`
- Progressive refinement is now split into a core module + CLI with a thin compatibility shim that warns on import, easing future deletions. `src/my3dis/progressive_refinement.py:1`, `src/my3dis/semantic_refinement_cli.py:1`

## 🔒 Security & Stability (Preserved)

- Multi-scene execution still relies on `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` without per-stage scheduling; concurrent workers can collide when `parallel_scenes > 1`. Add explicit GPU assignment once the ProcessPool fan-out is enabled again. `src/my3dis/workflow/executor.py:198`
- When the OOM watcher cannot read `memory.events`, we log a warning but still proceed with parallelism. Consider auto-disabling concurrency or failing fast to surface the issue. `src/my3dis/workflow/executor.py:178`, `oom_monitor/memory_events.py:1`
- Audit every remaining `torch.load` call (main repo + vendored third_party) and opt into `weights_only=True` or a safe loader before upstream flips the default. `third_party/semantic-sam/semantic_sam/BaseModel.py:26`

---

## ⚡ Performance & Resource Management (Preserved)

- Vectorise the gap-fill union in SSAM generation instead of coercing masks in Python loops; dense scenes still spike CPU and memory. `src/my3dis/generate_candidates.py:105`
- Expose chunk size/compression knobs for raw archive persistence so long sequences can trade throughput vs disk. `src/my3dis/raw_archive.py:33`, `src/my3dis/generate_candidates.py:544`
- Wire the OOM watcher feedback into orchestration so we automatically back off concurrency when `oom_kill` counters increment. `src/my3dis/workflow/executor.py:314`

---

## 📊 Observability & Reporting (Preserved)

- Surface `StageResourceMonitor` stats inside generated Markdown/CLI summaries so resource spikes are visible without digging through JSON. `src/my3dis/generate_report.py:20`, `src/my3dis/workflow/summary.py:94`
- Provide a small `report resources` helper that prints recent `workflow_summary.json` metrics for quick regressions. `src/my3dis/workflow/summary.py:342`

---

## 🛠️ Tooling & UX (Preserved)

- Update `tools/npz_interactive.py` to understand manifest-backed zip archives (`video_segments*.zip`, `object_segments*.zip`) so ad-hoc analysis aligns with the streaming writers. `tools/npz_interactive.py:1`
- Let `run_experiment.sh` read defaults from environment variables or a `.env` to keep CI and multi-machine setups from editing the script in place. `run_experiment.sh:17`
